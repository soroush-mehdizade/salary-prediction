# Salary Prediction – Polynomial & Neural Network Regression

This project explores a salary dataset using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies **Polynomial Regression** and **Neural Network Regression** models to predict salaries based on key features.  
The goal is to understand the main factors affecting salary and build accurate predictive models using advanced regression techniques.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze feature distributions and relationships
- Visualize trends and correlations
- Train and evaluate **Polynomial Regression** and **Neural Network Regression (PyTorch)** models
- Compare model performance using standard regression metrics

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focuses on:
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Understanding feature distributions  
- Correlation analysis between features and salary  
- Visualizations using statistical and graphical methods  

Key insights from the data are documented through plots and summary statistics.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The project uses two main regression approaches:

### 1. Polynomial Regression
- Captures nonlinear relationships between features and salary
- Degree of the polynomial is selected based on model performance

### 2. Neural Network Regression (PyTorch)
- Uses a feedforward neural network to learn complex patterns
- Configurable layers and neurons
- Optimized using PyTorch with appropriate activation functions and loss metrics

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
